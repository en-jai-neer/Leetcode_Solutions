Given a positive integer num, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

 

Example 1:

Input: num = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
Example 2:

Input: num = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
 

Constraints:

The given integer num is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
num >= 1
You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.

class Solution {
public:
    int findComplement(int num) {
        int ans = 0;
        int i = 0;
        while(num > 0)
        {
            if(num % 2 == 0)
                ans += pow(2, i);;
            i++;
            num /= 2;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};

int findComplement(long num) {
    long i;
    for(i=1;i<=num;i*=2) 
        num^=i; 
    return num;
}
